# 1.4 Operating-System Operations

## Life of Operating System (Boot Sequence)

- 최소 1개의 메모리와 1개의 Core
- Boot Loader를 통해 Memory에 OS가 올라감

1. Initialize primary CPU and other components in processor
2. Set up system components to operates computer
3. Wake secondary CPUs and initialize devices (ex. DMA 초기화)
4. Execute system programs(daemon) and become idle
5. OS Waiting for any events to occur

## Execution of Application Software

1. Program initially is stored in storage device
2. Load progream into main memory
3. Execute code of program line by line

## Process

1. Active instance of program in execution
2. Use computer resources to perform its tasks
3. What if process becomes idle?

## Multiprogramming

- 하나의 프로세스가 놀고 있는 동안에는 다른 프로세스를 실행
- Keep users stisfied and reduce CPU idle time
- Need techniques for resources to be shared

## Multitasking

- 여러 개의 프로세스를 놀고 동작하고를 반복
- 시분할 운영체제
- Switch processes periodically and frequently
- Provide faster response time to users
- Use timer to maintain control over CPUs
  - timer
    - Use clock signal and tick counter to get percise time
    - Periodic - Generate interrupts on every N times
    - One shot - Generate interrupts after N ticks

## Multimode Operation

- Hardware support for various execution modes
- At least two level - Kernel mode & user mode
- Limit every hardware access and some instructions
- mode bit를 통해 User Mode와 Kernel Mode를 따로 관리

## Scenario of Multimode Operation

- OS booting scene: Kernel Mode
- After booting: User Mode
- Any events given to Kernel: Kernel Mode
- User Mode => Kernel Mode로 오는 경우를 Exception(Trap)
  - Unauthorized hardware access from application
  - Interrupts raised by any hardware devices
  - Service requests from application to kernel
  - 결국 System Call(Software Interrupt, SWI)도 Exception을 통해서 일어나는 것
- Kernal Mode와 User Mode가 서로 넘어갈 때 Context Switching이 일어난다.

## Today's Operating System(POSIX Standard를 통해 개발)

- Multics(1964 / MIT, AT&T, GE)
- UNIX(1969 / Dennis Ritchie) - With C Language
- BSD(1977 / CSRG @ UC Berkeley)
- LINUX(1991 / Linus Trovalds) - And ... Git in 2005
- Darwin(2000 / Apple)
- Windows NT(1993 / Microsoft)
